A simple tutorial for developing a blockchain application from scratch in Python.

## What is blockchain? How it is implemented? And how it works?

Please read the [step-by-step implementation tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-develop-blockchain-app-in-python/index.html) to get your answers :)

## Instructions to run

Clone the project,

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app.git
```

Install the dependencies,

```sh
$ cd python_blockchain_app
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install merkle tool library & crypto,

```sh
pip install merkletools
```

Migrate database table,
```sh
$ python databse.py
```

Start a blockchain node server,

```sh
# Windows users can follow this: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/cli/#application-discovery
# set FLASK_APP=node_server.py
$ export FLASK_APP=node_server.py
$ flask run --port 8000
```

One instance of our blockchain node is now up and running at port 8000.


Run the application on a different terminal session,

```sh
$ python run_app.py
```

The web interface will be available in web browser, it should be in port 5000

To run multiple miners

```sh
# Make sure you set the FLASK_APP environment variable to node_server.py before running these nodes
# already running
$ flask run --port 8000 &
# spinning up new nodes
$ flask run --port 8001 &
$ flask run --port 8002 &
```

You can use the following cURL requests to register the nodes at port `8001` and `8002` with the already running `8000`.

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:8001/register_with \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"node_address": "http://127.0.0.1:8000"}'
```

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:8002/register_with \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"node_address": "http://127.0.0.1:8000"}'
```

This will make the node at port 8000 aware of the nodes at port 8001 and 8002, and make the newer nodes sync the chain with the node 8000, so that they are able to actively participate in the mining process post registration.

Once you mine the transactions, all the nodes in the network will update the chain. The chain of the nodes can also be inspected by inovking `/chain` endpoint using cURL.

```sh
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/chain
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8002/chain
```
